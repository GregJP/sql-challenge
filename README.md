# sql-challenge

### This challenge is an assignment given through the UNC Data Science Boot Camp. The instructions were to observe the CSV files provided and build an ERD based on them. Then, tables needed to be created in SQL through pgAdmin in order to import the data into them. After the tables and their respective data were in the database, we were required to display eight different specific queries showing the methods we learned so far in the SQL portion of the boot camp. An epilogue query was an additional requirement in order to add context to the assignment.
