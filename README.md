# sql-challenge

### This challenge is an assignment given through the UNC Data Science Boot Camp. The instructions were to build an ERD based on the CSV files provided in the EmployeeSQL folder. Then, tables needed to be created in SQL through pgAdmin in order to import the data from the CSVs. The code written for creating the tables can be seen in the table_schemata.sql file. After the tables and their respective data were in the database, we were required to display eight different specific queries showing the methods we learned so far in the SQL portion of the boot camp. An epilogue query was an additional requirement in order to add context to the assignment. All of those queires are stored in the queries.sql file.
